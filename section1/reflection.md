## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Taking breaks & taking care of oneself are definitely the big takeaways for me. I don't do either one of those super well all the time and I need to in order to learn more efficiently. I definitely need to read more than I currently am. I'll try to start with the Barbara Oakley book. The only thing I would add is to try new things. You can't "super learn" anything without taking the first step of trying it out.


1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

`puts "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

`#`

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An integer is any whole number, positive or negative. A float is any number, positive or negative, with a floating point decimal i.e. 5.5

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`puts animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

String Interpolation is the practice of combining variables within strings using #{} notation
`puts "The #{animal} has black & white stripes"`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

The method is gets and chomp is used frequently with this method to remove the new line that gets created from the gets method

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

- The length method gives the number of characters that the string has which includes spaces

- The split method creates an array of a string split by the spaces in the string. If there are no spaces, then the array will be combined as one item. However, one can avoid this by adding the type of splitting parameter. For example, `"This,is,a,string".split(,) => ["This", "is", "a", "string"]
