## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  1. I hadn't heard of SMART goals before. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, & time-bound goals would make my own goals more realistic & achievable.
  2. Having a growth mindset makes it seem like one would be unafraid of any problem they encounter. Learning from one's mistakes & actively seeking out challenges would definitely by tougher to do than sitting back & waiting for something to happen.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
   I'm not afraid to ask questions & I try to learn from my mistakes as much as I can. However, I don't actively seek out challenges & that's where I need to improve my growth mindset.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
   A hash is a collection storage & can have any data type in it using key-value pairs. The order does not matter in hashes.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
   ```ruby  
   pet_store = {"dog food": 40, "cat litter": 50, "fish" = 100, "snakes": 10}
   ```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
   `states["IA"]`
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
   `states.keys`
   `states.values`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
   We could use a hash for any type of customer data since the data types might vary between elements of the hash & it doesn't matter what the order of the customers are. A hash is better because it can store any data type as a key-value pair without any syntax issues. Additionally, not being restricted by order is also helpful.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
   I'll google my questions first.
